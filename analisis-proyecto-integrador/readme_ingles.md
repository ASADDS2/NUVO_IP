# Executive Report – Portfolio Risk and Profitability Analysis

## 1. Context and Objective

In this report, I present an executive analysis of the customer and loan portfolio, with the objective of providing a **clear and actionable view** of the portfolio size, its level of profitability, and the main risk drivers. The analysis is supported by key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations developed in Power BI, designed to support strategic decision-making.

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Total Customers

This indicator allows us to size the current portfolio. It is the starting point to understand the scale of the business and to put the remaining risk and profitability metrics into context.

### Total Loans

This KPI reflects the total volume of credit operations granted. As the number of loans increases, exposure also increases; therefore, this indicator is essential to assess the level of financial commitment assumed by the organization.

### Average Interest Rate

The average interest rate indicates the overall profitability level of the portfolio. This metric is particularly relevant to evaluate whether the expected return is aligned with the level of risk assumed in the loans granted.

### Average Late Payments

This KPI measures the average number of days payments are overdue and represents one of the main risk indicators. An increase in this value may anticipate liquidity issues and a higher probability of default.

**KPI Summary:**
With these indicators, we can quickly answer two key questions: **how large our portfolio is** and **how risky it is**, while maintaining a strong focus on profitability.

## 3. Interest Income Analysis by Loan Status

### Visualization: Column Chart

This chart shows the total interest paid segmented by loan status (active, closed, and delinquent).

From a business perspective, this visualization allows us to identify:

* Which loan status concentrates the highest interest income generation.
* Whether active loans are the main source of profitability.
* The weight of delinquent loans in interest income, which may imply higher returns but also higher risk.

This analysis is key to evaluating the balance between **income generation** and **risk exposure**.

## 4. Delinquency Analysis by Customer

### Visualization: Horizontal Bar Chart (Top 5)

This visualization presents the five customers with the highest average number of late payment days.

This analysis enables us to:

* Quickly identify customers with the highest risk of default.
* Prioritize follow-up, collections, or a review of credit conditions.
* Focus team efforts on the cases that generate the greatest negative impact on the portfolio.

Focusing on the Top 5 avoids dispersion and allows us to concentrate on the most critical risk points.

## 5. Loan Concentration by Customer

### Visualization: Column Chart

This chart shows how many loans each customer holds.

From a management perspective, this analysis is important because it:

* Identifies risk concentration in specific customers.
* Helps assess whether a significant portion of the portfolio depends on a small number of customers.
* Supports decision-making regarding credit limits and portfolio diversification.

## 6. Conclusions and Next Steps

Overall, this dashboard provides a clear view of the **financial health of the portfolio**. It allows us to identify customers and loans that generate higher profitability, as well as those that represent elevated risk.

As next steps, it is recommended to:

* Deepen the analysis of customers with higher delinquency levels.
* Assess whether interest rates adequately compensate for the risk assumed.
* Define preventive actions to reduce payment delays and improve overall portfolio quality.

This data-driven approach enables more informed decision-making and helps anticipate potential financial issues.
